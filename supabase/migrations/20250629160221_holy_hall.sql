  # Subreddit Reigns Feature

  1. New Tables
    - `subreddit_dilemmas` - Stores the post and comment pairs for the game
    - `subreddit_campaigns` - Defines the available subreddit campaigns
    - `player_campaigns` - Tracks player progress in each campaign

  2. Security
    - Enable RLS on all tables
    - Add policies for proper data access
